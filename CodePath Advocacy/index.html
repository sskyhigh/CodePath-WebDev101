                        <p>
                            Climate change is often cast as a prediction made by complicated computer models. But the
                            scientific
                            basis for climate change is much broader, and models are actually only one part of it (and, for
                            what
                            it’s worth, they’re surprisingly accurate).

                    <h2>The trap behind climate change</h2>
                    <p>For more than a century, scientists have understood the basic physics behind why greenhouse gases
                        like
                        carbon dioxide cause warming. These gases make up just a small fraction of the atmosphere but
                        exert
                        outsized control on Earth’s climate by trapping some of the planet’s heat before it escapes into
                        space.
                        This greenhouse effect is important: It’s why a planet so far from the sun has liquid water and
                        life!
                    </p>
                    <h2>Industrial Revolution</h2>
                    <p>However, during the Industrial Revolution, people started burning coal and other fossil fuels to
                        power
                        factories, smelters and steam engines, which added more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Ever
                        since,
                        human activities have been heating the planet.
