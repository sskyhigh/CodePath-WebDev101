                                Climate change is often cast as a prediction made by complicated computer models. But
                                the
                                scientific
                                basis for climate change is much broader, and models are actually only one part of it
                                (and, for
                                what
                                it’s worth, they’re surprisingly accurate).

                        <div class="firstText">
                            <p>For more than a century, scientists have understood the basic physics behind why
                                greenhouse gases
                                like
                                carbon dioxide cause warming. These gases make up just a small fraction of the
                                atmosphere but
                                exert
                                outsized control on Earth’s climate by trapping some of the planet’s heat before it
                                escapes into
                                space.
                                This greenhouse effect is important: It’s why a planet so far from the sun has liquid
                                water and
                                life!

                    <h2>Industrial Revolution</h2>
                    <p>However, during the Industrial Revolution, people started burning coal and other fossil fuels to
                        power
                        factories, smelters and steam engines, which added more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Ever
                        since,
                        human activities have been heating the planet.
